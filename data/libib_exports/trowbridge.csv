book,"Man Without A Face","Markus Wolf, Anne McElvoy, Marcus Wolf",Markus,Wolf,9781891620126,1891620126,"For decades, Markus Wolf was known to Western intelligence officers only as &quot;the man without a face.&quot; Now the legendary spymaster has emerged from the shadows to reveal his remarkable life of secrets, lies, and betrayals as head of the world&#039;s most formidable and effective foreign service ever. Wolf was undoubtedly the greatest spymaster of our century. A shadowy Cold War legend who kept his own past locked up as tightly as the state secrets with which he was entrusted, Wolf finally broke his silence in 1997. Man Without a Face is the result. It details all of Wolf&#039;s major successes and failures and illuminates the reality of espionage operations as few nonfiction works before it. Wolf tells the real story of Gunter Guillaume, the East German spy who brought down Willy Brandt. He reveals the truth behind East Germany&#039;s involvment with terrorism. He takes us inside the bowels of the Stasi headquarters and inside the minds of Eastern Bloc leaders. With its high-speed chases, hidden cameras, phony brothels, secret codes, false identities, and triple agents, Man Without a Face reads like a classic spy thriller&mdash;except this time the action is real.",PublicAffairs,1999-07-01,,,,,460,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-18,1

Yet remarkably, the setting for this best-known classic of spiritual literature is an ancient Indian battlefield.  At the last moment before entering battle, the great warrior Arjuna begins to wonder about the real meaning of his life. Why should he fight against his friends and relatives? Why does he exist? Where is he going after death? In the Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krsna, Arjuna&#039;s friend and spiritual master, brings His disciple from perplexity to spiritual enlightenment. In the course of doing so, Krsna concisely but definitively explains transcendental knowledge; karma-yoga, jnana-yoga, dhyana-yoga, and bhakti-yoga; knowledge of the Absolute; devotional service; the three modes of material nature; the divine and demoniac natures; and much more.  Bhagavad-gita As It Is is the largest-selling, most widely used edition of the Gita in the world.","Bhaktivedanta Book Trust",1989-06-01,,,,,636,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-18,1

Faith Herbert is a pretty regular teen. When she's not hanging out with her two best friends, Matt and Ches, she's volunteering at the local animal shelter or obsessing over the long-running teen drama The Grove.

When the fictional world of The Grove crashes into Faith's reality as the show relocates to her town, she can't believe it when TV heroine Dakota Ash takes a romantic interest in her.

book,"The Collapse: The Accidental Opening of the Berlin Wall","Mary Elise Sarotte",Mary,Sarotte,9780465064946,0465064949,"On the night of November 9, 1989, massive crowds surged toward the Berlin Wall, drawn by an announcement that caught the world by surprise: East Germans could now move freely to the West. The Wallinfamous symbol of divided Cold War Europeseemed to be falling. But the opening of the gates that night was not planned by the East German ruling regimenor was it the result of a bargain between either Ronald Reagan or George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.It was an accident.In The Collapse, prize-winning historian Mary Elise Sarotte reveals how a perfect storm of decisions made by daring underground revolutionaries, disgruntled Stasi officers, and dictatorial party bosses sparked an unexpected series of events culminating in the chaotic fall of the Wall. With a novelist&rsquo;s eye for character and detail, she brings to vivid life a story that sweeps across Budapest, Prague, Dresden, and Leipzig and up to the armed checkpoints in Berlin.We meet the revolutionaries Roland Jahn, Aram Radomski, and Siggi Schefke, risking it all to smuggle the truth across the Iron Curtain; the hapless Politburo member G&uuml;nter Schabowski, mistakenly suggesting that the Wall is open to a press conference full of foreign journalists, including NBC&rsquo;s Tom Brokaw; and Stasi officer Harald J&auml;ger, holding the fort at the crucial border crossing that night. Soon, Brokaw starts broadcasting live from Berlin&rsquo;s Brandenburg Gate, where the crowds are exulting in the euphoria of newfound freedomand the dictators are plotting to restore control.Drawing on new archival sources and dozens of interviews, The Collapse offers the definitive account of the night that brought down the Berlin Wall.","Basic Books",2014-10-07,,,,,320,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-18,1

In Schneider&#039;s Berlin, real people cross the Wall not to defect but to quarrel with their lovers, see Hollywood movies, and sometimes just because they can&#039;t help themselves&amp;#8212;the Wall has divided their emotions as much as it has their country.&quot;An honest, rich book. . . . It is one those rare books that come back at odd moments to intrude on your comfortable conclusions and easy images.&quot;&amp;#8212;Robert Houston, Nation","University of Chicago Press",1998-11-01,,,,,144,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-18,1
