book,Lifelines,"Leana Wen",Leana,Wen,9781250186232,1250186234,"From medical expert Leana Wen, MD,Lifelines is an insider's account of public health and its crucial role--from opioid addiction to global pandemic--and an inspiring story of her journey from struggling immigrant to being one ofTime's 100 Most Influential People. ""Public health saved your life today--you just don't know it,"" is a phrase that Dr. Leana Wen likes to use. You don't know it because good public health is invisible. It becomes visible only in its absence, when it is underfunded and ignored, a bitter truth laid bare as never before by the devastation of COVID-19. Leana Wen--emergency physician, former Baltimore health commissioner, CNN medical analyst, andWashington Post contributing columnist--has lived on the front lines of public health, leading the fight against the opioid epidemic, outbreaks of infectious disease, maternal and infant mortality, and COVID-19 disinformation. Here, in gripping detail, Wen lays bare the lifesaving work of public health and its innovative approach to social ills, treating gun violence as a contagious disease, for example, and racism as a threat to health. Wen also tells her own uniquely American story: an immigrant from China, she and her family received food stamps and were at times homeless despite her parents working multiple jobs. That child went on to attend college at thirteen, become a Rhodes scholar, and turn to public health as the way to make a difference in the country that had offered her such possibilities. Ultimately, she insists, it is public health that ensures citizens are not robbed of decades of life, and thatwhere children live does not determinewhether they live.","Henry Holt &amp; Company",2021-07-27,,,,,352,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-13,1

By 1942, as Edith was contemplating her first kiss, the Germans had begun to escalate their war against the Jews. Soon this bright, fun-loving girl was grappling with one of the most unfathomable events in human history. Edith&#039;s family &mdash; assimilated Dutch Jews &mdash; were caught in the cross fire of the Holocaust, and Edith began a bitter struggle to survive.In this extraordinary work, Edith Velmans weaves together revealing entries from her diaries with reminiscences and letters smuggled between family members during the occupation. Edith&#039;s Story stands as a profoundly important addition to the literature of the Holocaust, documenting one girl&#039;s grief, loss, courage, and ultimate triumph over devastating tyranny and despair. For as Edith is hidden in plain sight by a Christian family, we witness how a young woman must deny, bargain with, and finally face the horrors of war &mdash; and how, confronting evil as a child, Edith survives to become an extraordinary woman.",Bantam,2001-01-02,,,,,256,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-13,1
book,"The Flight Attendant (Television Tie-In Edition)","Chris Bohjalian",Chris,Bohjalian,9780593314005,059331400X,"Now a limited series on HBO Max starring Kaley Cuoco and Rosie Perez, a powerful story about the ways an entire life can change in one night: a flight attendant wakes up in the wrong hotel, in the wrong bed, with a dead man--and no idea what happened. Cassandra Bowden is no stranger to hungover mornings. She's a binge drinker, her job with the airline making it easy to find adventure, and the occasional blackouts seem to be inevitable. She lives with them--and the accompanying self-loathing. When she awakes in a Dubai hotel room, she tries to piece the previous night back together, counting the minutes until she has to catch her crew shuttle to the airport. She quietly slides out of bed, careful not to aggravate her already pounding head, and looks at the man she spent the night with. She sees his dark hair. His utter stillness. And blood, a slick, still wet pool on the crisp white sheets. Afraid to call the police--she's a single woman alone in a hotel room far from home--Cassie begins to lie. She lies as she joins the other flight attendants and pilots in the van. She lies on the way to Paris as she works the first class cabin. She lies to the FBI agents in New York who meet her at the gate. Soon it's too late to come clean-or face the truth about what really happened back in Dubai. Could she have killed him? If not, who did? Set amid the captivating world of those whose lives unfold at forty thousand feet, The Flight Attendant unveils a spellbinding story of memory, of the giddy pleasures of alcohol and the devastating consequences of addiction, and of murder far from home.","Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group",2020-12-08,,,,,368,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-13,1
