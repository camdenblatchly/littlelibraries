book,"The Dalai Lama's Cat","David Michie",David,Michie,9781401940584,1401940587,"Oh! How adorable! I didn&#039;t know you had a cat&#039; she exclaimed. I am always surprised how many people make this observation. Why should His Holiness not have a cat? &#039;If only she could speak&#039; continued the actress. &#039;I&#039;m sure she&#039;d have such wisdom to share&#039; And so the seed was planted . . . I began to think that perhaps the time had come for me to write a book of my own - a book that would convey some of the wisdom I&#039;ve learned sitting not at the feet of the Dalai Lama but even closer, on his lap. A book that would tell my own tale . . . how I was rescued from a fate too grisly to contemplate to become the constant companion of a man who is not only one of the world&#039;s greatest spiritual leaders and a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate but also a dab hand with a can opener Starving and pitiful, a mud-smeared kitten is rescued from the slums of New Delhi and transported to a life she could have never imagined. In a beautiful sanctuary overlooking the snow-capped Himalayas, she begins her new life as the Dalai Lama&#039;s cat. Warmhearted, irreverent, and wise, this cat of many names opens a window to the inner sanctum of life in Dharamsala. A tiny spy observing the constant flow of private meetings between His Holiness and everyone from Hollywood celebrities to philanthropists to self-help authors, the Dalai Lama&#039;s cat provides us with insights on how to find happiness and meaning in a busy, materialistic world. Her story will put a smile on the face of anyone who has been blessed by the kneading paws and bountiful purring of a cat.","Hay House Visions",2012-10-01,,,,,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-13,1

book,"Sweet Theft: A Poet's Commonplace Book","J.D. McClatchy",J.D.,McClatchy,9781619027138,1619027135,"Centuries ago, when books were rare, those who owned them would lend them to friends, who in turn would copy out passages they especially liked before returning the precious book to its owner. These anthologies came to be known as Commonplace Books, and modern writers as different as W. H. Auden and Alec Guinness have kept them as well, recording phrases or passages that struck them as wise or witty or quirky. The result is as much the self-portrait of a sensibility as it is a collection of miscellaneous delights. Renowned poet J. D. McClatchy has been keeping such a book for three decades now. This selection from it offers a unique look into what strange facts, what turns of mind or phrase, what glorious feats of language and nature can attract the attention of a poet.    The great and the obscure are gathered around the same table, exchanging remarkable opinions. Henry James is speaking of Venice: The deposed, the defeated, the disenchanted, the wounded, or even only the bored, have seemed to find there something that no other place could give.” At the other end of the table, Groucho Marx is playing drama critic: I didn’t like the play, but then I saw it under adverse circumstancesthe curtain was up.” Nietzsche and Flaubert, Dizzy Gillespie and Marianne Mooredozens of unexpected and timeless aphorisms and anecdotes that pierce and provoke. Many of McClatchy’s own observations about the art and prowess of writing are included as well.

Working with the actual testimony of Schindler&#039;s Jews, Thomas Keneally artfully depicts the courage and shrewdness of an unlikely savior, a man who is a flawed mixture of hedonism and decency and who, in the presence of unutterable evil, transcends the limits of his own humanity.",Touchstone,1993-12-01,,,,,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-13,1

Don Lee's collection offers vivid, entertaining proof that ethnicity is never straightforward or easy--no matter who we are, or where we stand."" --Jennifer Egan, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of A Visit from the Goon Squad ""Whatever you're hiding from may find you in a Don Lee story. But this isn't a warning. The Partition is, again and again, about Asian Americans in ways we don't always admit we need, a collection about how we alternately cheat and show up for each other and ourselves. And the whole time, there's a canny, shrewd love, guiding us the way through."" --Alexander Chee, author of How to Write an Autobiographical Novel Twenty-one years after the publication of his landmark debut collection Yellow, Don Lee returns to the short story form for his sixth book, The Partition. The Partition is an updated exploration of Asian American identity, this time with characters who are presumptive model minorities in the arts, academia, and media. Spanning decades, these nine novelistic stories traverse an array of cities, from Tokyo to Boston, Honolulu to El Paso, touching upon transient encounters in local bars, restaurants, and hotels. Culminating in a three-story cycle about a Hollywood actor, The Partition incisively examines heartbreak, identity, family, and relationships--the characters searching for answers to universal questions: Where do I belong?

book,"Democracy Awakening: Notes on the State of America","Heather Cox Richardson",Heather,Richardson,9780593652961,0593652967,"New York Times Bestseller “Engaging and highly accessible.”—Boston Globe “A vibrant, and essential history of America's unending, enraging and utterly compelling struggle since its founding to live up to its own best ideals… It's both a cause for hope, and a call to arms.”--Jane Mayer, author Dark Money From historian and author of the popular daily newsletter LETTERS FROM AN AMERICAN, a vital narrative that explains how America, once a beacon of democracy, now teeters on the brink of autocracy -- and how we can turn back. In the midst of the impeachment crisis of 2019, Heather Cox Richardson launched a daily Facebook essay providing the historical background of the daily torrent of news. It soon turned into a newsletter and its readership ballooned to more than 2 million dedicated readers who rely on her plainspoken and informed take on the present and past in America. In Democracy Awakening, Richardson crafts a compelling and original narrative, explaining how, over the decades, a small group of wealthy people have made war on American ideals. By weaponizing language and promoting false history they have led us into authoritarianism -- creating a disaffected population and then promising to recreate an imagined past where those people could feel important again. She argues that taking our country back starts by remembering the elements of the nation’s true history that marginalized Americans have always upheld. Their dedication to the principles on which this nation was founded has enabled us to renew and expand our commitment to democracy in the past. Richardson sees this history as a roadmap for the nation’s future. Richardson’s talent is to wrangle our giant, meandering, and confusing news feed into a coherent story that singles out what we should pay attention to, what the precedents are, and what possible paths lie ahead. In her trademark calm prose, she is realistic and optimistic about the future of democracy. Her command of history allows her to pivot effortlessly from the Founders to the abolitionists to Reconstruction to Goldwater to Mitch McConnell, highlighting the political legacies of the New Deal, the lingering fears of socialism, the death of the liberal consensus and birth of “movement conservatism.” Many books tell us what has happened over the last five years. Democracy Awakening explains how we got to this perilous point, what our history really tells us about ourselves, and what the future of democracy can be.",Viking,2023-09-26,,,,,304,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-13,1

Dilbert is sweeping the nation. &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; dubbed him &quot;the cartoon hero of the workplace, &quot; saying that the strip &quot;has its finger on the pulse of the &#039;90s white-collar workplace.&quot; Now online, it is one of the hottest Web sites on the Internet, and more than a million copies of the &quot;Dilbert&quot; cartoon books have been sold. In this latest cartoon compilation, Dilbert&#039;s canine sidekick, the Machiavellian Dogbert, presents a breakthrough management manual to help bosses stick it to their employees. All too often, new managers make mistakes like rewarding good work with good pay, communicating clearly and improving departmental efficiency. Dogbert shows that this could have devastating results: Employees begin to expect fair treatment and compensation, productive workers show results (making the managers look bad by comparison) and the department&#039;s future budget allotment could be decreased because it spends only what it needs. Drawn from years of experience tormenting Dilbert and advising his boss, &quot;Dogbert&#039;s Top Secret Management Handbook&quot; uses pithy essays, whose points are illustrated with hundreds of comic strips, to drive home the lost cause of the employee in the workplace. It is the perfect gift for bosses and office workers everywhere.&quot;[Adams] turns the powerful searchlight of his intelligence on management, seeking its very essence.

How to stimulate your baby's mental development and help him turn his 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward describes the incredible mental developmental changes (leaps) and regression periods that all babies go through. Understanding the real reason behind crying, eating and sleeping problems is the only real solution every parent needs. The Wonder Weeks reveals what's going on inside baby's mind. Including a bonus chapter with everything about the relationship between sleep and leaps, as well as unique insight into your baby's sleeping behavior.The book includes:Week-by-week guide to baby's behaviorWhen to expect the fussy behavior, what this implies (cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior) and how to deal with these regression periods (leaps)A description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going throughFun games and gentle activities you can do with your childUnique insight into your baby's sleeping behaviourThe book is based on the scientific- and parental-world-changing discovery of a phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more fussy at very nearly the same ages, regression periods, and sleep less in these phases.These age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention (regression periods) are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback―everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet. He needs you to guide him and understand what he is going through! Get ready to rediscover the world all over again with your baby… Bonus: Sleep, and the lack of sleep... that's something we all have to deal with when we have a baby. The bonus chapter includes everything about the relationship between sleep and leaps, as well as unique insight into your baby's sleeping behavior.
