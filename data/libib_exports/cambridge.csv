book,"Tropic of Cancer","Henry Miller",Henry,Miller,9780802131782,0802131786,"Now hailed as an American classic, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller&rsquo;s masterpiece, was banned as obscene in this country for twenty-seven years after its first publication in Paris in 1934. Only a historic court ruling that changed American censorship standards, ushering in a new era of freedom and frankness in modern literature, permitted the publication of this first volume of Miller&rsquo;s famed mixture of memoir and fiction, which chronicles with unapologetic gusto the bawdy adventures of a young expatriate writer, his friends, and the characters they meet in Paris in the 1930s. Tropic of Cancer is now considered, as Norman Mailer said, one of the ten or twenty great novels of our century.&rdquo;","Grove Press",1994-01-06,,,,,318,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-18,1

Diamond",Jared,Diamond,9780060845506,0060845503,"The Development of an Extraordinary SpeciesWe human beings share 98 percent of our genes with chimpanzees. Yet humans are the dominant species on the planet -- having founded civilizations and religions, developed intricate and diverse forms of communication, learned science, built cities, and created breathtaking works of art -- while chimps remain animals concerned primarily with the basic necessities of survival.

This landmark study shows that the Western owes its perennial appeal not to unchanging conventions but to the deftness with which it responds to the obsessions and fears of its audience. And no obsession, Lee Mitchell argues, has figured more prominently in the Western than what it means to be a man.""Elegantly written. . . . provocative . . . characterized by [Mitchell's] own tendency to shoot from the hip.""—J. Hoberman, London Review of Books""[Mitchell's] book would be worth reading just for the way he relates Benjamin Spock's Baby and Child to the postwar Western.""—The Observer""Integrating a careful handling of historical context with a keen eye for textual nuances, Mitchell reconstructs the Western's aesthetic tradition of the 19th century.""—Aaron M.
