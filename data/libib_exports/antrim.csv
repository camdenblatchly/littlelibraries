book,"The Canary Islands: A Cultural History (Landscapes of the Imagination)","Peter Stone",Peter,Stone,9781908493996,1908493992,"The seven volcanic Canary Islands that bask in the Atlantic off shore from the north-west African coast have long had legendary connotations. To the Greeks they were the Gardens of the Hesperides, blessed with a perennial spring-like climate, while the Carthaginians christened them the 'Purple Isles' on account of the rich dye material they obtained there. Inhabitants have ranged from the early Berber-descended Guanches, of whom cultural traces still remain, to the rich blend of European and Latin peoples that evolved after the Spanish conquest in the fifteenth-century. Famous visitors have included Columbus, Humboldt and General Franco, who famously flew from Gran Canaria in a (British-piloted) Dragon Rapide in 1936 to launch Spain's Civil War. In today's cosmopolitan capitals of Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife Spanish colonial-era buildings merge with modern centres equipped with sophisticated amenities. For holidaymakers tiny ecologically-oriented havens like Gomera vie with big brash tourist resorts like Playa del Ingles and Playa de las Americas, today's major money-makers after the brief trade boom of yesteryear. Peter Stone explores the fascinating history and culture of this archipelago, where nature and geology provide a spectacular setting for today's tourism industry. FANTASY LANDSCAPE Bone dry 'badlands', orange-grey dunes, giant craters, frozen lava flows, black-sanded coves, rich green bananas plantations and sylvan woodlands shrouded in perennial mists all form part of this multi-faceted paradise. NATIONAL PARKS AND WILD LIFE Four of Spain's fifteen great national parks are located on the islands; Tenerife's 3,700-metre Teide, the country's highest mountain, is the most visited. Island fauna vary from the desert-like lizards of Lanzarote to the rich bird life of La Palma. UNIQUE LOCAL CULTURE Local fiestas abound and traditional dance and music exhibitions are held in cultural centres like Gran Canaria's Pueblo Canario. Mould-breaking Lanzarote architect Cesar Manrique has left a supreme legacy of innovative buildings and monuments.","Signal Books",2014-09-25,,,,,256,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-16,1
book,"Get Out of My Life, but First Could You Drive Me & Cheryl to the Mall: A Parent's Guide to the New Teenager, Revised and Updated","Anthony E. Wolf",Anthony,Wolf,9780374528539,0374528535,"A brand new edition of the bestselling guide to raising teenagersWhen Anthony E. Wolf's witty and compassionate guide to raising adolescents was first published, its amusing title and fresh approach won it widespread admiration. Beleaguered parents breathed sighs of relief and gratitude. Now Dr. Wolf has revised and updated his bestseller to tackle the changes of the past decade. He points out that while the basic issues of adolescence and the relationships between parents and their children remain much the same, today's teenagers navigate a faster, less clearly anchored world. Wolf's revisions include a new chapter on the Internet, a significantly modified section on drugs and drinking, and an added piece on gay teenagers. Although the rocky and ever-changing terrain of contemporary adolescence may bewilder parents, Get Out of My Life gives them a great road map.","Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2002-08-01,,,,,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-16,1
