book,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","Jared M. Diamond",Jared,Diamond,9780393317558,0393317552,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize.In this ""artful, informative, and delightful"" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.

Whose standard of beauty motivates African Americans to straighten their hair? What inspires beauty queens to measure up as flawless objects for the male gaze? Why does a French performance artist use cosmetic surgery to remake her face into a composite of the master painters' version of beauty? How does beauty culture perceive the disabled body? Is the constant effort to remain young and thin, often at considerable economic and emotional expense, ethically justifiable? Provocative essays by an international group of scholars discuss aesthetics in aesthetics, the arts, the tools of fashion, the materials of decoration, and the big business of beautification―beauty matters―to reveal the ways gender, race, and sexual orientation have informed the concept of beauty and driven us to become more beautiful. Here, Kant rubs shoulders with Calvin Klein. Beauty Matters draws from visual art, dance, cultural history, and literary and feminist theory to explore the values and politics of beauty. Various philosophical perspectives on ethics and aesthetics emerge from this penetrating book to determine and reveal that beauty is never disinterested.","Indiana University Press",2000-05-22,,,,,352,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-18,1

Written and directed by Shyamalan, who had been working on the script since he was 25, the 1999 film was a landmark in on-screen storytelling and the evolution of the horror and supernatural thriller genres. With a cast that included Bruce Willis, Mischa Barton, Toni Collette, Donnie Wahlberg, and Haley Joel Osment, it earned six Oscar nominations and made Shyamalan a household name overnight, launching a career that would include such movies as Signs, Unbreakable, The Visit, Split, and Old.In I See Dead People, entertainment journalist Mackenzie Nichols weaves together interviews with Shyamalan, the movie’s stars, crew members, and others into an oral history of how this iconic movie was made. Nichols gives a collective account of the unusual filming process―principalphotography took place in the soon-to-be-demolished Philadelphia Convention Center, in which cast and crew experienced inexplicable paranormal phenomena―traces the movie’s surprising success and lasting influence, and even speaks with professional mediums about how itshaped public perception of the paranormal.

book,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks","Rebecca Skloot",Rebecca,Skloot,9781400052189,97814000521,"Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells&mdash;taken without her knowledge&mdash;became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&rsquo;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&mdash;as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb&rsquo;s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the &ldquo;colored&rdquo; ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta&rsquo;s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia&mdash;a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo&mdash;to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. Henrietta&rsquo;s family did not learn of her &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family&mdash;past and present&mdash;is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family&mdash;especially Henrietta&rsquo;s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother&rsquo;s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn&rsquo;t her children afford health insurance?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.",Broadway,2011-03-08,,,,,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-06-18,1
